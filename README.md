# spending_tracker_project

This is my solo project at the end of the Ruby section of my CodeClan course.
The app uses SQL to manipulate a database which can be modified via the user interface. 
Sinatra is used to host the interface in a browser.

Transactions are added to the homepage, and each is given a category and marchant, which are added on a separate page.

I carried out a large amount of UX for this project, interviewing various colleagues and instructors to establish the most useful features of a spending tracker app.
Familiar colours are used, particularly in the navigation menu.
The interface also maximises potential profit, factoring in space for adverts on each page.
